# Implementing-KNN-DT

The assignment consisted of implementing the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) machine
learning algorithms from scratch, applying them on two fixed benchmark data sets acquired from the web, and
analyzing their performance.

To ensure maximal accuracy, we tested on many different values for the hyper parameters, and also implemented
a weighted version of KNN to compare performance. We found that KNN performed better than DT on both
data sets in terms of loss, AUROC, and AUPRC, even though DT proved to have better accuracy on the Hepatitis
data sets which is imbalanced.
